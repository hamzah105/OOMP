# OOMP + TRACE: local live quickstart

Use the approved `trace-live` profile at `D:\os-trace-live-1108`. Its existing
owner, credentials, database and grants are preserved. A one-time private local
handoff selects that profile for this TRACE checkout; other installations remain
unchanged. The local launcher and selection are installed only with owner approval.

## Two terminals

Open fresh PowerShell terminals so old manually exported settings do not override
the approved connection. Terminal 1:

```powershell
oomp start
```

Terminal 2:

```powershell
cd 'D:\Desktop\VU BS-CS\CS619\TRACE'
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

Use TRACE's own activation. `python` and `uvicorn` must resolve from TRACE's
`.venv\Scripts`; do not inject OOMP's site-packages with `PYTHONPATH`. The private
handoff transfers connection settings and existing secret references, never Python
import paths. No token, owner ID, Mongo URI or repeated setup prompt is needed.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` and then `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login.html`.
Sign in using the existing approved TRACE owner account. No account or password
is created by this integration, and another user's login cannot switch the pinned
memory owner. Browser/OAuth login and final model answers require manual testing.

## Fictional cross-session check

In a new TRACE session, send `I am developing a project called LUMENLOCAL.`.
After the completed interaction is approved and published, create another session
and ask `What is my LUMENLOCAL project?`. Inspect evidence/provenance separately
from the model's answer. A running worker or HTTP200 alone does not prove recall.
Optional follow-ups can state a fictional alias, response preference, tentative
relocation and later correction. An unsupported pet question should retain
uncertainty. This walkthrough creates new fictional interactions; do not backfill
private historical conversations.

The normal chatbot answer path uses TRACE's configured local model. The setup and
automated health checks do not request model inference or download weights.

## Status and shutdown

```powershell
oomp status
oomp doctor --full
oomp stop
```

Stop the TRACE test/development server with Ctrl+C in Terminal2. `oomp stop`
authenticates and stops only the selected managed supervisor and its children.
It preserves the profile, data, credentials and one-time connection configuration.
`oomp up`, `down`, explicit profile options and existing diagnostics remain available.

### Start again after a recoverable supervisor exit

Use the same command; do not delete or rename runtime files manually:

```powershell
oomp start
```

An authenticated running supervisor is reused. For an orphaned unfinalized runtime
record, automatic recovery requires a definitely dead supervisor PID, free
recorded control and configured MCP ports, the real free OS operation lock, an
unchanged valid private record/profile and serialized launch ownership. An alive
or reused PID, inconclusive liveness, a held lock, occupied port, changed record or
unsafe permissions blocks recovery without signalling an unverified process.

The original record is retained privately under the profile's
`history/recovery-*/runtime.json`. It includes an old control token; do not print,
share or commit it. Existing memories, WAL/SHM files, credentials, owner, scope,
grants and the approved TRACE handoff are preserved. Normal service authentication,
MCP, configured Context V1 and database readiness must pass before the CLI prints
recovery/startup success. These rules describe the product behavior, not a new
test against an existing live profile.

If another start is in progress (`profile_busy`), let it finish before retrying.
For other refusal codes, retain the private evidence and use the
[recovery code reference](docs/product-cli.md#automatic-stale-supervisor-recovery).
Do not kill a PID or bypass a changed-state warning. Pipe EOF requests orphan
child shutdown; an in-flight Mind job may drain before its worker exits, governed
by the existing leases/fencing. Recovery does not force-stop those processes.

If no setup exists, `oomp start` opens a guided wizard in an interactive terminal.
It detects the selected project/Python, prompts for a missing owner ID, validates
only that ID against the selected users collection, presents read-only or approved
publication authority, and requests approval before creating files or credentials.
It never chooses a different user, rebinds an existing profile or rotates secrets.

## Troubleshooting and boundaries

A PSReadLine `System.Console.SetCursorPosition` exception belongs to PowerShell's
console editor. It does not establish that OOMP or Windows crashed. The recovery
patch changes no global PowerShell settings, Windows services, drivers or security
policy, and does not establish why a previous supervisor exited.

An `on_startup` Router error indicates an incompatible/mixed web stack. The
measured compatible TRACE environment is FastAPI0.115.0, Starlette0.38.6,
Uvicorn0.54.0, Pydantic2.14.1 and MCP2.3.0. TRACE's own `pip check` passes. The
reported error was reproduced when OOMP's Starlette1.10.0 preceded TRACE on the
import path; do not reinstall an already consistent environment unnecessarily.

Invalid signatures, file permissions, changed profile bindings or conflicting
explicit settings fail closed. The ignored `.oomp.local.json` contains signed
references, not copied credential values. Do not share private profile/configuration
files, print secrets or commit them. Keep `.env` unchanged. A changed local profile
requires a new reviewed handoff rather than silent owner or grant changes.

Approved signed connection settings take precedence over legacy OOMP defaults in
`.env`. A different dotenv owner or conflicting inherited process settings are
rejected. Other TRACE dotenv settings continue to load normally. The selected
MongoDB configuration stays unchanged; only the publisher's in-memory `localhost`
reference is converted to literal loopback for its existing admission check.

The default selection is private at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OOMP\startup\selection.json`. The local `oomp.cmd` launcher uses
the existing user Scripts directory; setup changes neither PATH nor installed
packages. Existing profile/credential bytes remain unchanged.

## Executed verification: 8 November 2026

The exact activated reload command returned `/health` 200 after database readiness
and application startup. Its owned test server was stopped and port 8000 released.
Bare OOMP start/status/stop and full doctor were exercised; OOMP was left running
with all three managed services ready. Full doctor: 26 PASS, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL,
5 NOT TESTED. Focused checks: 94 unique OOMP passes and 62 TRACE passes, three
service-dependent TRACE tests deselected, no unexpected final skips. An earlier
incorrectly selected physical-Mongo test was blocked before connection; that failed
safety phase is preserved and excluded from acceptance. The corrected collection
was verified before execution with stronger fail-closed monitoring.

Browser login/OAuth and final cross-session model answers remain manual checks.
No model generation/download or private historical-chat backfill was performed.

This is one trusted local owner in an isolated profile. The general multi-principal
scheduler limitation remains open. Legacy source reads retain tenant/namespace
scope. No broad multi-user, remote-host, crash-resolution or production claim is made.
